Objective of PS_Format_xlsx_file.ps1 is to look for a file {simplified_reports__funding.csv} and rename using this naming convention {Funding Transactions_$date.xlsx} and save it as an {.xlsx}. Code has another feature which is TBD with automation at present. After naming convention, file extension is saved as an {.xlsx} type. Code will take data in excel file and populate it in a table.
